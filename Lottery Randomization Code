This excel file contains the randomized draws I ran for the NBA draft lottery.
Lottery results were drawn from the results generated on http://basketball.realgm.com/nba/draft/lottery_simulator
For players drafted in top 14 picks from 2004 on I compared the correlations between actual team quality and performance and randomly predicted team quality and performance
